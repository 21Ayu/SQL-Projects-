Problem Statement:

 The Apple retention team wants to calculate the percentage of buyers who bought AirPods directly after buying iPhones, with no intermediate purchases in between.

ðŸ“˜ Clarifications:
* The user must have purchased an iPhone first, followed immediately by AirPods.
* Even if both are purchased on the same day, iPhone must appear first in the transaction order.
* No other product should be purchased between the iPhone and AirPods.

ðŸ“Š Sample Input Table: transactions

transaction_id customer_id product_name transaction_timestamp 
1 101 iPhone 08/08/2022 00:00:00
2 101 AirPods 08/08/2022 00:00:00
5 301 iPhone 09/05/2022 00:00:00
6 301 iPad 09/06/2022 00:00:00
7 301 AirPods 09/07/2022 00:00:00

ðŸ§  Approach:
* Use ROW_NUMBER() to assign the transaction order for each customer.
* Join consecutive transactions and check for "iPhone â†’ AirPods" sequence.
* Count such users and compute the percentage over all unique customers.
