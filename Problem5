🧾 Problem Statement

 Accenture is identifying Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) based on employees' experience across different domains. An employee qualifies as an SME if they meet either of the following:

 ✅ 8 or more years of experience in a single domain
 ✅ 12 or more years of experience across two different domains
 ❌ Employees with experience in more than two domains are excluded.

📊 Sample Input Table: Employee_expertise

| Employee_id | Domain         | Years_of_experience |
|------------- |------------------------ |---------------------- |
| 101      | Digital Transformation | 9           | 
| 102      | Supply Chain       | 6           |
| 102      | IoT           | 7            |
| 103      | Change Management    | 4           |
| 104      | DevOps          | 5           |
| 104      | Cloud Migration     | 5          |
| 104      | Agile Transformation   | 5           |



🧠 Approach:

=>Select employees with ≥ 8 years in a single domain
=>Union with employees who have ≥ 12 years across exactly two domains
=>Exclude employees with experience in more than two domains
=>Group by employee_id and apply conditions using HAVING

SQL Query :-

SELECT employee_id
FROM employee_expertise
WHERE years_of_experience >= 8

UNION

SELECT employee_id
FROM employee_expertise
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING SUM(years_of_experience) >= 12 AND COUNT(*) = 2;
