9            4            4/15/2022        QuickBooks Online


Approach :
Used CTEs & Window Function(Row_Number) to filter data , rank records and group similar records . 

SQL Query:

WITH filtered_data AS (
 SELECT 
 user_id, 
 YEAR(filing_date) AS filing_year
 FROM filed_taxes
 WHERE product LIKE '%TurboTax%'
), 
ranked_data AS (
 SELECT 
 user_id,
 filing_year,
 ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY filing_year) AS rn
 FROM filtered_data
),
grouped_data AS (
 SELECT 
 user_id,
 filing_year,
 rn,
 filing_year - rn AS year_group
 FROM ranked_data
),
consecutive_streaks AS (
 SELECT 
 user_id,
 COUNT(*) AS consecutive_years
 FROM grouped_data
 GROUP BY user_id, year_group
 HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
)
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM consecutive_streaks
ORDER BY user_id;
