###Problem Statement

####Server Utilization Time
 SQL Interview Question

ABC is a cloud based company  & is powered by fleets of servers. Senior management has requested data-driven solutions to optimize server usage.

Write a query that calculates the total time that the fleet of servers was running. The output should be in units of full days.

Assumptions:

Each server might start and stop several times.

The total time in which the server fleet is running can be calculated as the sum of each serverâ€™s uptime.

server_utilization Table:

Column_Name	        Type
server_id       	  integer
status_time  	      timestamp
session_status	    string

server_utilization Example Input:

server_id	           status_time	         session_status
1	              08/02/2022    10:00:00	        start
1	              08/04/2022    10:00:00          stop
2	              08/17/2022    10:00:00          start
2	              08/24/2022    10:00:00          stop





APPROACH->

1.USING WIINDOW FUNCTION ROW_NUMBER() TO RANK ROWS FOR SAME SERVER (WIIL BE USEFUL TO PERFORM JOIN LATER ON).
2.GETTING START TIME FOR EACH SERVER THROUGH CTE.
3.GETTING STOPTIME FOR EACH SERVER THROUGH CTE .
4.AT LAST JOINING THE BOTH CTE AND SUBTRACTING STOP TIME FROM START TIME FOR EACH SERVER .

Final Query:

WITH start_sessions AS (
    SELECT 
        server_id,
        status_time AS start_time,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY server_id ORDER BY status_time) AS session_number
    FROM server_utilization
    WHERE session_status = 'start'
), 
stop_sessions AS (
    SELECT 
        server_id,
        status_time AS stop_time,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY server_id ORDER BY status_time) AS session_number
    FROM server_utilization
    WHERE session_status = 'stop'
), 
session_durations AS (
    SELECT 
        start.server_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (stop.stop_time - start.start_time)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM start_sessions AS start
    JOIN stop_sessions AS stop
        ON start.server_id = stop.server_id 
        AND start.session_number = stop.session_number
)
SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(duration_seconds) / 86400, 0) AS total_uptime_days
FROM session_durations;
